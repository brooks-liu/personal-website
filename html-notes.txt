Front-end design:

HTML is used to add aspects like text, images, or icons to a webpage. It is not for styling/aesthetics.


How the web works:

url - uniform resource locator (documents, images, fonts, etc.)
A query goes from the browser/client to the host/server - client/server model
http (hypertext transfer protocol) or https (http with encryption) is used to communicate between client and server in a request/response loop,
called a protocol

To render the website, the client requests all of the needed files like images and such from the server

index.html is usually the homepage of a website


On a webpage, to access developer tools (useful when building side by side to see changes) use ctrl+shift+i 

HTML is not case sensitive (thankfully), always start a document with <!DOCTYPE html>

Most elements have an opening and closing element like <html> </html>

Here are a couple useful ones:
<head> is a heading 
<title> is the title of the webpage
<body> is the stuff on the page
<img> is for adding images - src is for the image path, alt is for text that will display if image can't be rendered
<p> for paragraph (of text) - text elements use this
    you can also include the class="" classificiation after p, and if you make a p.class css element to change paragraphs of that class
