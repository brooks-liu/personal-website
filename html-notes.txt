Front-end design:

HTML VALIDATOR: validator.w3.org


HTML is used to add aspects like text, images, or icons to a webpage. It is not for styling/aesthetics.
Use the Prettier extension to make consistently formated html documents 

How the web works:

url - uniform resource locator (documents, images, fonts, etc.)
A query goes from the browser/client to the host/server - client/server model
http (hypertext transfer protocol) or https (http with encryption) is used to communicate between client and server in a request/response loop,
called a protocol

To render the website, the client requests all of the needed files like images and such from the server using the DOM (document object model)

index.html is usually the homepage of a website


On a webpage, to access developer tools (useful when building side by side to see changes) use ctrl+shift+i 

HTML is not case sensitive (thankfully), always start a document with <!DOCTYPE html>

Most elements have an opening and closing element like <html> </html>, and you can add a language declaration

Here are a couple useful ones:
<head> used to give more information about a webpage (which is why <style> goes in here)
    for example, <meta charset="utf-8"> defines the character set used on the webpage. for bext practice, include these:
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=width-device, intial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta> gives attributes to a website, like how <meta name="description" content=""> writes the description for the webpage that 
    shows up on the web
    the name="keywords" helps with search engine optimization
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"> refreshes the page every 30 seconds
<title> is the title of the webpage
<body> is the stuff on the page
<h1> through <h6> are heading sizes
    don't use these for the size, use this for the heiarchy (cause you can always change size using css), and only use ONE h1 element
    can use this to organize <p> elements
    can add identifier like <h2 id="section1"> to create unique section identifiers
<img> is for adding images - src is for the image path, alt="" is for text that will display if image can't be rendered, title="" for a description
<p> for paragraph (of text) - text elements use this
    you can also include the class="" classificiation after p, and if you make a p.class css element to change paragraphs of that class
<audio src=""> can put controls before src to add controls, can also include autoplay, muted and loop 
    if you want multiple audios, make audio open and close tags, then put a bunch of <source=""> tags between them, and add some error text as well
<video src=""> same thing as audio (see above)
<em> for emphasizing. it defaults to italics, but you can change what it does using css 
<strong> for important stuff (similar to <em>). defaults to bold
<br> line break (doesn't need closing tag)
<hr> horizontal rule (straight line to separate sections)
<span> is like a create your own function, anything you put inbetween you can change the style, only applies within a section
<div> is the same as span but for full blocks
<header> and <footer> are self explanatory

To display entities (like if you wanted to type <> on the website), use &stuffhere;
    for example: &lt;HTML&gt; means less than/greater than --> <HTML>
    for a complete list just search for html entities reference list
    &nbsp; ensures words are always put together and line breaks dont break the two words on different lines

To hyperlink:
    anchor element <a href="filename"> </a> --> adding a "download" afterward the filename will make it downloadable
    can hyperlink to a different section of the page using a unique identifier, and type href="#section-name" to link to there
    you can make a link that auto jumps to the top by using href="#"
    go to an external website--> href="https://..."
        can use target=_blank afterwards to open it in a new tab or _self to open in the same window
        title="" can be used to create the popup description
    to link to email--> href=="mailto:email"

<iframe src="https://bing.com"> will imbed bing onto your website (a lot of websites don't let you do this)

<button></button> you can disable the button by adding the disabled boolean

HTML Lists:
Unordered List:
    <ul>
        <li>item</li>   --> these create bullets
    </ul>

Ordered List:
    <ol type="">
        <li>item</li>   --> creates a numbered list, can set to letter, number, roman numeral using type
    </ol>

Description List:
    <dl>
        <dt>  (description term)
            Term
        </dt>

        <dd>   (desciption definition)
            This is indented as a default
        </dd>
    </dl>

HTML Tables:
<table bgcolour="">
    <tr bgcolour="" align="">    (table row, background colour, align type)
        <th>    (table header)
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>    (table data)
        <td>
    </tr>
</table>

HTML Forms:
<form action="form_data.php" method="GET"> 
--> action will tell the page to send the data inputted to somewhere. GET puts the info in the url, POST is secure

    <label for="fname">First Name:</label>  --> good practice to fill out a for attribute
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" placeholder="Type Here" required> 
    --> variable when user gives input, placeholder and required are self explanatory

    <input type="password" maxlength="12">   --> hides the text, adds maxlength
    <input type="email">
    <input type="tel">
    <input type="data>
    <input type="number">

    <div>   --> these are options that are in the same group (have same name), so you can only select one
        <label>Male</label>
        <input type="radio name="samename">

        <label>Female</label>
        <input type="radio name="samename">

        <label>Other</label>
        <input type="radio name="samename">
    </div>

    <div>   --> for dropdown menu
        <label for="country">Country:</label>
        <select id="country" name="country">
            <option>Canada</option>
            <option>US</option>
            <option>Mexico</option>
        </select>
    </div>

    <div>   --> for checkboxes
        <label for="subscribe">Subscribe?</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="subscribe" name="subscribe">
    </div>

    <input type="reset">
    <input type="submit"> 
</form>
