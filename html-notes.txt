Front-end design:

HTML VALIDATOR: validator.w3.org


HTML is used to add aspects like text, images, or icons to a webpage. It is not for styling/aesthetics.
Use the Prettier extension to make consistently formated html documents 

How the web works:

url - uniform resource locator (documents, images, fonts, etc.)
A query goes from the browser/client to the host/server - client/server model
http (hypertext transfer protocol) or https (http with encryption) is used to communicate between client and server in a request/response loop,
called a protocol

To render the website, the client requests all of the needed files like images and such from the server using the DOM (document object model)

index.html is usually the homepage of a website


On a webpage, to access developer tools (useful when building side by side to see changes) use ctrl+shift+i 

HTML is not case sensitive (thankfully), always start a document with <!DOCTYPE html>

Most elements have an opening and closing element like <html> </html>, and you can add a language declaration

Here are a couple useful ones:
<head> used to give more information about a webpage (which is why <style> goes in here)
    for example, <meta charset="utf-8"> defines the character set used on the webpage. for bext practice, include these:
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=width-device, intial-scale=1.0" />
<title> is the title of the webpage
<body> is the stuff on the page
<img> is for adding images - src is for the image path, alt is for text that will display if image can't be rendered
<p> for paragraph (of text) - text elements use this
    you can also include the class="" classificiation after p, and if you make a p.class css element to change paragraphs of that class
