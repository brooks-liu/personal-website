# personal-website

This is my personal website for job recruiters to view, anyone interested to follow, and (most importantly) so I can keep myself accountable.
I will be using this to learn HTML and CSS, and (hopefully in the future) expand on it with JavaScript, React, and package managers like NPM.
The goal is to become proficient in full-stack development and then promptly forget all of it after the website is finished (just kidding, I hope).
I will NOT copy and paste anything I swear (I'll do my best to make it from scratch, and without copilot or chatgpt)
