# personal-website
 This is my personal website for job recruiters to view, anyone interested to follow, and (most importantly) so I can keep myself accountable.
 I will be using this to learn HTML and CSS, and (hopefully in the future) expand on it with JavaScript, React, and package managers like NPM.
