How to style!

CSS VALIDATOR: jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

You can write css in the html doc by using <style>, and it goes in the <head>
To edit an element (like an image):

img {
    <!--this is where css declarations go, common ones include: -->
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    float: left; --> pushes image to left
    margin-right: 10px; --> distance between image and text on the right
    object-fit: cover;  --> image covers the image box (whatever width/height you define that the image might not fit)
}
p {
    font-weight: bold;
    font-style: normal;
    colour: blue;
}

p.class {
    <!--applies to all paragraphs with the class "class"-->
}

.class {
    <!--applies to all classes called "class", not just paragraphs-->
}
