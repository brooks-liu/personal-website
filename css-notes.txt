How to style!

You can write css in the html doc by using <style>, and it goes in the <head>
To edit an element (like an image):

img {
    <!--this is where css declarations go, common ones include: -->
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    float: left; --> pushes image to left
    margin-right: 10px; --> distance between image and text on the right
}
p {
    font-weight: bold;

}

p.class {
    <!--applies to all paragraphs with the class "class"-->
}

.class {
    <!--applies to all classes called "class", not just paragraphs-->
}
