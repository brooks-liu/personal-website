How to style!

CSS VALIDATOR: jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

There are three types of CSS styling: inline, internal, and external
Inline is like so:
    <body style="background: black; height: 100px;">
Internal is where you include a <style></style> box in the <head> of a document, and add the styles like seen below
External (probably the one I'm going with):
    Link a file (style.css) to the html file by using <link rel="stylesheet", href="style.css"> in the <head> tag
    If you want to uniquely edit a certain aspect, create an id using <tag id="name"> and then use #name{css stuff} to reference them
    If wanted a class of objects, use <tag class="name"> and then use tag.name or .name to reference them

Some common ones:

img {
    <!--this is where css declarations go, common ones include: -->
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    float: left; --> pushes image to left
    margin-right: 10px; --> distance between image and text on the right
    object-fit: cover;  --> image covers the image box (whatever width/height you define that the image might not fit)
}
p {
    font-weight: bold;
    font-style: normal;
    colour: blue;  or colour: rgb(1, 1, 1);  you can also use hexcode (just paste the hexcode)
    font-family: verdana, arial;   --> font! (with backup)
    font-size: 16px; --> 16 is standard, can also use 1em (16px and scales with multiplier so 2em would be 32px)
    font-weight: bold;
    font-style: italic;
}

p.class {
    <!--applies to all paragraphs with the class "class"-->
}

.class {
    <!--applies to all classes called "class", not just paragraphs-->
}


To add fonts:
    You can add fonts through a link:  <link href="fonts.google.com link"> under the <head> tag and then you can use them in your CSS file
    can also include the files for the fonts in your directory, just use the ttf file and then do the following at the top of the CSS file:
        @font-face{
            src: url(filepath);
            font-family: font_name;
        }
        And do this separately for all fonts that you uploaded 

Borders:
h1 {
    border-style: solid;   (dashed, dotted, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, none)
    border-width: 2px;
    border-colour: blue;
    border-radius: 5px;    --> round corners
    border-bottom: 3px, solid, red;
}
can also include the first three lines in one line: border: 3px solid black;

Text/Box Shadows:
p{
    text-shadow: 3px 5px 2px red;   --> right shift, down shift, blur, colour   - you can add multiple shaoows in one text-shadow, just add comma
}
div.box1{
    background-colour: grey;
    box-shadow: 3px, 3px, 2px, black;  --> same as text-shadow
}
